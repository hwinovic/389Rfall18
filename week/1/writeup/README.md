### Part 2 (75 pts)
To begin handling this situation, you should first go to your boss and express your concerns about the complex security problems that you have found. If they do not take any action towards the situation, then you can go to the person that your boss reports to. If someone internally takes on the challenge to fix these problems, then the public does not need to find out because they are not in danger anymore. If the company completely ignores you, then that is the time that you can warn the public of the dangers because they would not know otherwise. Another option that is feasible is to make a government agency that deals with the type of manufacturing aware of the concerns and get their help fixing those security issues. Further, if the company is unwilling to postpone the ECU’s release, then it is also ethical to tell consumers about the security problems that they are vulnerable to because doing so could save their lives in the case of an engine unit in a car. Doing nothing about the security issues is unethical because with your knowledge you could potentially save lives. You should be responsible for any harm that results from not telling the company about the issues because your job is to audit the ECU’s firmware.
